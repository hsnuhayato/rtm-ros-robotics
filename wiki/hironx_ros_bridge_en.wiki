This page is English translation of [https://code.google.com/p/rtm-ros-robotics/wiki/hironx_ros_bridge this page in Japanese]. In case this page (the one you're on) looks outdated, please consult the original page or ask in the mailing list.

= Motivation =
hironx_ros_robotics is now [http://www.ros.org/wiki/catkin/migrating_from_rosbuild#Overview catkinized] but still compatible with ROS' old building style called rosbuild (or its commadn line interface rosmake). This page discusses installation of catkin version using rosbuild.

= Install =

First, install ROS by following its wiki.
http://ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Ubuntu

Then,

{{{
$ mkdir ros/groovy; cd ros/groovy
$ wstool init
$ wstool merge http://rtm-ros-robotics.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/agentsystem_ros_tutorials/rtm-ros-robotics.rosinstall  
$ wstool update
$ rosmake hironx_ros_bridge
}}}

# [http://www.ros.org/wiki/wstool wstools] takes over rosws for catkin workspace.

== Installation tweaks ==
At the moment, a lot of tweaks are needed [http://code.google.com/p/rtm-ros-robotics/issues/detail?id=175 as reported in this thread].

(TODO these tweaks will be filled)
