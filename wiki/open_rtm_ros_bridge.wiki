Ok, then you can go to hrpsys directory

you can see
 rtmbuild_genbridge()
in CMakeLists.txt. this converts all idl files to msg/srv with make
command and generate ROSBridge source code under src_gen directory.

hrpsys/sample/hrp4c-rosbridge.launch is the example.
first you select ServiceBridgeComponent for corresponding OpenRTM
service under src_gen directory
  <node name="SequencePlayerServiceROSBridgeComp" pkg="hrpsys"
type="SequencePlayerServiceROSBridgeComp"
        args='$(arg openrtm_args)'>
    <param name="service_port" value="service0"/>
  </node>

and then you modify rtactivate and rtconnect tag for your Bridge Component
