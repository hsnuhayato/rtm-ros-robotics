         The OMG has developed the Robot Technology Component (RTC) specification
as a way to increase the efficiency of robot development. Based
on this specification, AIST has developed the OpenRTM-aist. RT
System Editor is one of the development tools included in this
architecture. It is used for manipulating RT Components in a
real-time graphical interface. It is a plugin for the Eclipse
IDE, and interacts seamlessly with other Eclipse plugins.
RTC Builder is a template generator tool for RT Components. It
generates custom templates based on user-configured parameters.
RTC Builder operates on top of Eclipse and interacts seamlessly
and intuitively with other Eclipse plugins. Although RTC Builder
can be used even if RT System Editor is not installed, if it
is, RTC Builder&apos;s menus will be integrated with those of RT System
Editor. This document is written assuming RT System Editor is
installed.
