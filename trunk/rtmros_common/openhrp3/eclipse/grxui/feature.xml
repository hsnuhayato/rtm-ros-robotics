THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
      PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR
      DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE
      OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
      documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i) changes to the Program, and

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and
      are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
      'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program
      by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
      Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
      the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software
      distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own
      license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the
      Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
      which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its
      Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
      Agreement, including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense
      the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
      derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to
      sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
      Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This
      patent license shall apply to the combination of the
      Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is
      added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution
      causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed
      Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se
      is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances
      are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not
      infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any
      other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
      Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on
      infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a
      condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted
      hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to
      secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if
      any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to
      allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's
      responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the
      Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
      copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the
      copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

      and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
      conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties
      or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular
      purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability
      for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
      consequential damages, such as lost profits;
